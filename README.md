# Odin-EtchASketch

Now that the RPS UI has been made, it is time to move on to the next project. This project is to build a mix between a notepad and an EtchASketch. This will be to make a grid of squares and allow the user to alter the size of this grid. I will also need to create hover effects when a user's mouse goes over a square to create a EtchASketch style of look.
